# The Future of Multimodal Reasoning

Multimodal models are no longer just a research curiosity; they are becoming the backbone of intelligent systems.

## Why it matters
The ability for a model to "see" and "hear" provides a context that text alone cannot capture. This post dives into:
1. Architectural shifts from CLIP to GPT-4o.
2. The challenges of alignment across modalities.
3. Emerging applications in robotics.

Stay tuned as we navigate this exciting frontier.
